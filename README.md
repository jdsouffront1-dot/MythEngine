MythEngine

Relational Dynamic Type Theory (RDTT) Experiments
An exploration of information, coherence, and emergent intelligence.


---

Overview

MythEngine is an experimental Haskell-based framework designed to test the hypothesis that reality itself operates as an information-coherence system.
The project unites symbolic computation, physics, and cognitive theory to explore how meaning density (MD) and coherence restoration (C¬∑) might form the basis of both physical and mental processes.


---

Core Idea

At its foundation, MythEngine models the universe as a self-correcting information network.
Each element (INode) and relationship (ERel) carries meaning density, evolving through cycles of coherence and decoherence ‚Äî a dynamic balance that reflects both thought and physical law.
The framework proposes that intelligence, life, and even spacetime geometry may be emergent expressions of coherence optimization.
